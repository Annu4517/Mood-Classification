**Project Title**

Mood Classification Using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying human mood based on input data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to understand how different features contribute to mood prediction and to build a basic classification model that can predict mood categories effectively.

**Objectives**

To explore data related to mood classification
To preprocess and prepare data for machine learning
To train and evaluate a classification model
To understand the performance of the model using evaluation metrics

**Technologies Used**

Python
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn

**Methodology**

Data loading and exploration
Data preprocessing and feature preparation
Model training using machine learning algorithms
Model evaluation using accuracy and other metrics
Result analysis and observations

**Results**

The trained model was able to classify moods with reasonable accuracy. The results highlight the importance of proper preprocessing and feature selection in improving model performance.
